I want to refine the existing expense tracking form UI to improve its user experience, making it feel more like a smooth, elegant Typeform-style interaction.

### üîπ Key Areas for Improvement:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Question Flow & Transitions**
   - Currently, questions appear abruptly. Instead, they should **slide up smoothly (ease-out 250ms) and fade in (opacity 0 ‚Üí 1)** when a new question appears.
   - When going **back**, the previous question should **slide down gently** instead of switching abruptly.
   - When exiting a question, it should **fade out and slide up (opacity 1 ‚Üí 0)**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Input Field Interactions**
   - **Right now:** Inputs feel static. Let's improve engagement with:
     - A **subtle scale effect (scale(1.05)) on focus**.
     - A **soft shadow glow (box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1))** to make selections feel more dynamic.
   - Dropdowns should **open smoothly (0.2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))** instead of instantly appearing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Button Styling & Microinteractions**
   - The **Next button** should feel more responsive. Add:
     - A **hover effect with slight elevation (translateY(-2px))**.
     - A **gentle pop (scale(1.02)) when clicked**, followed by the next question animating in smoothly.
   - The **Back button** should have a similar effect but **less pronounced (translateY(-1px))**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Progress Bar**
   - The progress indicator **currently updates too suddenly**. It should expand **smoothly (ease-in-out 0.5s)** as the user advances.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual & Thematic Refinements**
   - **Background:** Adjust to a **soft matcha green (#D8E2C6) with a radial gradient** for subtle depth.
   - **Card UI:** Currently, the form feels boxy. Improve by:
     - Using **Sand Dune (#F0E5D4)** for a warm, neutral feel.
     - Increasing **padding to 32px** and rounding corners to **border-radius: 16px**.
     - Adding a **subtle drop shadow (0px 10px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05))** to create a floating effect.
   - **Typography:** The question text should appear **one at a time in a conversational format** with a **larger font (24px-28px, bold)** for readability.
   - **Microcopy:** Instead of generic prompts, use a more **conversational tone** (e.g., ‚ÄúNice! What‚Äôs next?‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúNext‚Äù).

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Technical Improvements**
   - The current form feels slightly rigid. Refactor to **use Framer Motion for smoother transitions** (or CSS transforms: `translateY()` and `opacity` for performance).
   - Consider breaking the form into **separate React components** for each question to improve reusability and state control.

### **üîπ Final Goal:**
These refinements should make the form feel **smoother, more engaging, and more intuitive**, mimicking a **Typeform-like conversational flow**. The focus is on **elegant transitions, microinteractions, and an overall delightful user experience**.

Let me know what refinements can be applied based on these insights!
